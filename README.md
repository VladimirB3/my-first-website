# My Very First Web Page

Welcome!

My name is Vladimir and you have happened to stumble upon my initial steps in coding - on a quest to becoming the most inventive and hard working Software Developer that has ever graduated from Code Institute.

In this particular repository you will find my-first-website which has been used to gain some understanding on how to use Github, Gitpod and rescuing my work from surtain death.

Please find time to give constructive critique to my work in progress, as well as finished projects.

Keep on keeping on!
